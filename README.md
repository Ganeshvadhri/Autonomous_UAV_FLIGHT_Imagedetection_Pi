# Autonomous_UAV_FLIGHT_Imagedetection_Pi
To develop a UAV fleet that can fly autonomously, identify green colored cubes of 15 cm in a 40*40m grid and subsequently communicate the location of the target to the remaining drones and the ground station using swarm technology and finally plot the G.P.S coordinates on a map and display it on a monitor.
